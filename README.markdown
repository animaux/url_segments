# URL Segments

Version: 1.1  
Requirements: Symphony 2.3

## Installation ##

1. Upload the 'url_segments' folder in this to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "URL Segments" and choosing 'Enable' from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. Sequentially numbered URL segments will now be added to the param output.

## Usage ##

As of version 1.0.1 the extension now includes the "URL Segments as XML" datasource. You'll need to add this DS to your pages to be able to use it. 1.0.1 also includes a slight change to the behaviour when on the `index` page, if you're on the `index` page the extension will output the params as though it were on the fully resolved URL of that page
